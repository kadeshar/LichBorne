## Recent Changes (v2.0)

* **Class Tab help button** — A new `?` help icon has been added to the header bar for the Class tab. Hover it to see an explanation of class tab filtering, spec icon click-to-assign, gear slot hover inspection, and the count bar.
* **"All" tab renamed to "Overview"** — The All tab is now called Overview throughout the addon: tab label, frame names, and all internal references updated.
* **Stop Scan now works during Add Group phase** — Fixed a bug where pressing Stop during the member-adding phase of Add Group or Full Group Scan had no effect. The scan would continue adding characters and proceed through all phases regardless.
* **Full Group Scan** — The Full Scan button has been renamed to Full Group Scan. It runs all three scan phases automatically in sequence: add members → scan gear → scan specialization. No manual button clicks required between phases. Allow \~6 seconds per member.
* **Options panel** — A gear (⚙) button opens a new Options panel. 
* **Help buttons for Raid and Overview tabs** — Two new help icons added to the header bar. Hover the Raid Tab icon for instructions on tier/raid selection, adding characters, and using Invite Raid or Invite Group. Hover the Overview Tab icon for instructions on adding/removing from raid, inviting to group, filtering, and sorting.
* **Raid filter button** — A new filter button in the Filters row lets you show only characters in your currently selected raid. When active, all other characters are hidden across Class and Overview tabs. Useful for confirming who has or hasn't been added to a roster.

\---

## Raid Tab

Up to 40 slots across two columns. Each slot shows class icon, spec icon, name, iLvL, GS, needs, role, notes, and delete button.

### Raid Controls

* **Column header sorting** — Click Spec, Name, iLvL, GS, or Role to sort

### Raid Filter

The filter button on Class and Overview tabs, when active, shows *only* characters currently in your selected raid — hiding everyone else. Useful for confirming who has been added to a roster.

### Invite Raid / Invite Group

* **INVITE RAID** — Automatically logs out old bots, leaves party, converts to raid, and invites all roster members via `.playerbots bot add`. Always invites from the currently selected raid's table.
* **INVITE GROUP** — Invites the 5-Man team from the TO 5-Man Dungeons tab. Operates independently of whichever tab is active.

Use the Group dropdown (A/B/C) to manage multiple raid parties.

> \*\*Note:\*\* Raid configurations are saved after reloads and must be manually cleared.
